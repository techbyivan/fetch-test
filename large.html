<!-- 2. Show today's weather
Create a new app (with an index.html and an index.js) that uses data from the OpenWeather API.

Retrieve the current weather for your city using fetch() and create a pipeline of 
.then() functions that draw the data to the page.

Make sure to .catch() any errors that might occur.

Once you can retrieve the weather for a hard-coded city, 
try using the browser's Geolocation API to automatically find the user's location.

The Geolocation API is asynchronous, but uses the callback style. 
Wrap these API calls in a new Promise so that it can be incorporated into your Promise chain. -->
